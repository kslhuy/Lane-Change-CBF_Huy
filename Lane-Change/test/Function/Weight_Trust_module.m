        function W = calculate_weights_Defaut(self ,  vehicle_index )
            % Function to calculate consensus weights for a given virtual graph
            %
            % Parameters:
            %   Vj - Adjacency matrix representing the virtual graph. It is a square 
            %        matrix where Vj(i, j) = 1 if there is an edge between node i and 
            %        node j, and 0 otherwise.

            % Returns:
            %   W - Weight matrix where W(i, j) represents the weight assigned to the 
            %       edge between node i and node j. The weights are calculated based 
            %       on the degree of each node.
            %
            % The function initializes a weight matrix W with zeros. For each node i 
            % (starting from the second node), it calculates the degree d_i of the node. 
            % Then, for each node l, if there is an edge between node i and node l or 
            % if i equals l (self-loop), it assigns a weight of 1 / (d_i + 1) to W(i, l).
