            Evaluate velocity with a tolerance range for minor deviations.
            
            Parameters:
                v_y: Reported velocity of the follower vehicle.
                v_leader: Leader's velocity.
                a_leader: Leader's acceleration.
                b_leader: Beacon interval (time since the last beacon).
                tolerance: Acceptable fraction of v_ref deviation without penalty.
            
            Returns:
